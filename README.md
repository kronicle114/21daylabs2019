# 2019 21 Day Coding Challenge

## Challenge 1 - Door to Door

Our challenge begins in Codeville, a small but thriving town in Serverside, Canada, where you are the current mayor nearing the end of your first term. Election season is nearing, and this town needs you, so you've decided to run for a second term. However, you need some help to make sure the election and your campaign run smoothly. Enter JavaScript, a coding language sure to help you optimize the many elements of the upcoming election and (hopefully) secure your return as Mayor.

As your election campaign ramps up, you plan to go door to door to talk to the citizens of Codeville. There are quite a few neighbourhoods in Codeville, but lucky for you, we have a dedicated crew of volunteers to help out. Being the fair Mayor that you are, you want to make sure the work is distributed evenly between the team. Let's figure out how many neighbourhoods each volunteer should visit.

Instructions
Given an array of volunteer names and an array of neighbourhood names, complete the doorToDoor function so that it returns the number of neighbourhoods each volunteer should visit if the work of going door to door is split evenly amongst them.

Examples
```javascript
// Input:

const volunteers = [
      'Sally',
      'Jake',
      'Brian',
      'Hamid'
    ];

    const neighbourhoods = [
      'Central Valley',
      'Big Mountain',
      'Little Bridge',
      'Bricktown',
      'Brownsville',
      "Paul's Boutique",
      'Clay Park',
      'Fox Nest'
    ];
    
Output:
2
```

Hint: We can use JavaScript's handy built-in .length method to get the length of each array! This will help you figure out how many volunteers and how many neighbourhoods there are.


## Challenge #2 - Something to Talk About
Thanks to your tireless volunteers, the word is out that you're running for a second term, and the local media has come calling!

The Lighthouse Gazette wants to interview you about your campaign, but you're a nervous interviewer! To help prepare for your interview you want to use JavaScript to practice campaign stance on important election topics. The list of possible question categories includes:

arts funding
economy
transportation
Instructions
Given a question topic, complete a function interviewAnswer(topic) that returns your stance on that particular election issue. The answer should be returned as a string.

When asked about arts funding, the function should return "We'll have to get creative!"
When asked about the economy, the function should return "Time is money."
When asked about transportation, the function should return "It's going to be a long road, so we better get moving."
If you're asked about a topic that isn't in the list above, respond with a default statement. (For example, "QUACK!")

Examples
```javascript 
// Input: 
const topic = 'economy'
// Output:
'Time is money.'
//Input:
const topic = 'transportation'
// Output:
`It's going to be a long road, so we better get moving.`
```

## Challenge #3 - Securing the Vote
Click here to learn how to navigate the code editor

It looks like you've got a hold of your campaign for now. So you've been asked to turn your attention to making sure the election infrastructure is ready to go! Codeville County is using a new e-voting platform to make elections simpler and more secure. We need to test out the software to make sure it's working correctly before Election Day.

Instructions
When a resident casts their vote, the system will be passed the name of the candidate they voted for and the current standings. It will then update the standings, adding the new vote to the count.

To test the system, we'll need to complete the function castVote(name, votes) that takes in the name of a candidate and an array of tallied votes. The function should return an array with the updated standings.

We will be testing the system with three possible candidates: Tim, Sally and Beth. Each item in the votes array represents the number of votes for a particular candidate:

The first item in the array votes[0] are the votes for Tim
The second item in the arry votes[1] are the votes for Sally
The third item in the array votes[2] are the votes for Beth
For example in this array [0, 2, 1] there are 0 votes for Tim, 2 votes for Sally and 1 vote for Beth.

Examples

```javascript 
// Input:

    const name = 'Sally';
    const votes = [
      0, // Tim
      2, // Sally
      1 // Beth
    ]
    
// Output:

    [
      0, // Tim
      3, // Sally
      1 // Beth
    ]
// Input:

    const name = 'Tim';
    const votes = [
      1, // Tim
      1, // Sally
      2 // Beth
    ];
    
// Output:

    [
      2, // Tim
      1 // Sally  
      2 // Beth
    ]

```

Hint: We'll need to start with an if statement to determine who the vote is for. Once we know that we can use the increment operator (++) to increase votes[0] for Tim, votes[1] for Sally or votes[2] for Beth.

For instance, if name === 'Tim', then we want to increment votes[0]++.

### Challenge #4 - This is How You Remind Me (To Register To Vote)
Now that you've squashed all the bugs in the city's new voting software, it's time to jump back on the campaign trail. The election is coming up soon! You need to send out reminders to all Codeville citizens to encourage them to vote, but you don't want to spam people who have already registered. Use JavaScript to remove all registered voters from your contact list.

Instructions
Complete the function registerToVote(name, unregisteredVoters) that takes in the name of a newly registered voter and an array of names of those who have not yet registered to vote. Your function must return an array, with the newly registered voter's name removed.

Examples
```javascript
// Input:

    const name = 'Bradley';
    const unregisteredVoters = ['Jake', 'Alanna', 'Bradley', 'Stephanie'];
    
// Output:
['Jake', 'Alanna', 'Stephanie']
```

Hint: If we initialize a new empty array within our function, let mailingList = [], we can use a for-loop and an if-statement to push the right names into it.

Or if we're feeling adventurous, let's take a look at JavaScript's filter function. You can see an example of how to remove an item from an array using filter here.

## Challenge #5 - Voting Station Calculation
The election is looming, and the dutiful City of Codeville staff has finalized most of the details, except for one thing: where will citizens vote? There are hundreds of buildings in town, but there are very specific requirements for what constitutes an acceptable voting station. With very little time to decide, the city needs our help to sort through the building data.

Instructions
Complete the function chooseStations(stations) that takes in an array of possible voting stations, and then only returns the names of the stations that are appropriate.

Your function will receive an array of stations, where each station itself is an array with a name, a capacity, and a venue type.

In order for a station to be deemed appropriate, it must have a capacity of at least 20, and be a school or community centre.

Examples
```javascript
Input:

    const stations = [
      ['Big Bear Donair', 10, 'restaurant'],
      ['Bright Lights Elementary', 50, 'school'],
      ['Moose Mountain Community Centre', 45, 'community centre']
    ];
    
Output:
['Bright Lights Elementary', 'Moose Mountain Community Centre']
```

Hint: You'll need to try out some new comparison operators for this. Take a look at how to do greater-than, not-equal, and logical-AND with JavaScript.

Much like the previous challenge, one way we could solve this is by initializing a new array within our function (let goodStations = []) and push the stations that meet the requirements to it as we loop through them.

## Challenge #6 - Turn Out For What
Phew, with our help the city staff were able to select the voting stations on time and the election went off without a hitch! Now that the votes have been cast, the Election staff needs to verify the votes by matching each voter's signature to their voter ID.

Instructions
Complete the function voterTurnout(), that will take in two arrays. The first array is a list of voter ids, and the second array is a list of voter signatures, which correspond to the voter ids. Our task here is to first check that each array have the same number of items and then confirm that each of the voter ids matches the corresponding voter signature.

If the arrays do not contain the same number of items, then we know something is amiss and our function should return false. If they contain the same number of elements, then we should proceed to check if the two arrays are identical, meaning they contain the same names in the same order. If they are, our function should return "All clear, we can count the votes!", if they are not it should return "FRAUD!".

Examples
```javascript 
//Input:

      const voter_signatures = [
        'Bill Billiamson',
        'Kate Etak',
        'Brandon Brandonus',
        'Fake McFakerson',
        'Jane Janesford'
      ]

      const voter_ids = [
        'Bill Billiamson',
        'Kate Etak',
        'Brandon Brandonus',
        'Simon Simonson',
        'Jane Janesford'
      ]
//Output:
'FRAUD!'

// Input:

      const voter_signatures = [
        'Bill Billiamson',
        'Kate Etak',
        'Brandon Brandonus',
        'Simon Simonson',
        'Jane Janesford'
      ]

      const voter_ids = [
        'Bill Billiamson',
        'Kate Etak',
        'Brandon Brandonus',
        'Simon Simonson',
        'Jane Janesford'
      ]
    
// Output:
'All clear, we can count the votes!'
```

## Challenge #7 - You Choose, (You Don't) Lose
The people of Codeville have spoken, and you have been elected mayor once again! Now it's time to get back to work. You need to decide which issues to focus on first for your new term in office. Using the dataset from voter surveys, determine the top three issues voters were most concerned about when choosing the new Codeville leadership.

Instructions
We need to go through the survey responses to see what your constituents would like you to focus on over the course of your term in office. The array that you are given contains many phrases and words pulled from a number of interviews. We only want to focus on the following three key phrases: "smart city", "arts funding", and "transportation".

Our termTopics function needs to count how many times each of those topics was mentioned in the surveys, and then return an array with the number of mentions in the following order: smart city, arts funding, and then transportation.

Examples
```javascript
// Input:

    const interviews = [
      'smart city', 
      'rebuild the lighthouse', 
      'arts funding', 
      'transportation',
      'arts funding', 
      'rebuild the lighthouse', 
      'sports funding', 
      'tax cuts', 
      'smart city',
      'arts funding', 
      'smart city'
    ]
    
// Output:

    [
      3, // smart city
      3, // arts funding
      1  // transportation
    ]
```

## Challenge #8 - Trash to Treasure
The results are in, and the people of Codeville want you to focus on Smart City upgrades. You've decided to begin by replacing all of the city's trash cans with smart cans: when citizens toss their rubbish into the smart can, it automatically sorts items into waste, recycling, and compost bins.

Instructions
We need to complete a function called smartGarbage(trash, bins), which will be responsible for increasing the garbage count for waste, recycling, or compost depending on what trash is submitted. Our function will receive two arguments. The first argument, trash, is a string that will tell our function what type of item is being submitted. The second argument, bins, is an object containing three properties (waste, recycling, and compost), which hold some numerical value. Our function must increase the correct value in the bins object, and the return the newly updated object.

Examples
```javascript
// Input

    const bins = {
        waste: 4,
        recycling: 2,
        compost: 5
    }

    const trash = 'recycling'
    
const output = {
        waste: 4,
        recycling: 3,
        compost: 5
}
```
Hint: This is the first time we've encountered objects! We will need to access the proper value in the bins object using the trash as the key. If you're having trouble with this, take a look online to see how to use square bracket notation to access values in a JavaScript object.

Note: When we’re referencing a variable in the bracket notation, we can skip the quotes.


## Challenge #9 - Driving Mayor Daisy
As Mayor, you want one of your legacies to be bettering street design enough to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. You've decided to start by installing special sensors on some streets to monitor how often cars pass by, and track their speeds.

Instructions
Complete the function, carPassing(cars, speed), that takes in an array of car objects, and the speed of a car as it passes the sensor. This function should create a new object with with a property called speed, and another property called time and add it to the cars array. We can retrieve the current time, for setting the time property, by using the Date.now() function, which is built into JavaScript!

Our function should return an array that includes all of the elements in cars as well as our new element.

Examples
```javascript
// Input:

    const cars = [
      {
        time: 1568329654807,
        speed: 40,
      },
      {
        time: 1568329821632,
        speed: 42,
      },
      {
        time: 1568331115463,
        speed: 35
      }
    ]
   

   const speed = 38
    
const output = 
[
      {
        time: 1568329654807,
        speed: 40,
      },
      {
        time: 1568329821632,
        speed: 42,
      },
      {
        time: 1568331115463,
        speed: 35
      },
      {
        time: 1568431216417,
        speed: 38
      }
    ]
```

Hint: We can define and create a new object with an object literal. You can check out the first list item here as an example.

Like in previous challenges, we may need to use JavaScript's handy push() method to add our new object to the cars array.

## Challenge #10 - SmartParking
The parking lot in the Codeville Devtropolis Shopping Mall needs an upgrade, and you've decided this is the perfect opportunity to install a smart parking system.

The system will use special parking sensors to keep track of all parking spots and monitor which ones are available. Every time a vehicle enters the parking lot, the system directs them to an available spot for their particular vehicle type, or notifies them that no spots are available.

Instructions
We need to write a function called whereCanIPark() that returns the coordinates of an available parking spot for the vehicle, or returns false if there is no available spot. Our function receives an array of arrays representing parking spots, and a string with type of the vehicle that is looking for a parking spot.

There are three kinds of possible vehicles: regular cars, small cars, and motorcycles. Regular cars can only park in R spots. Small cars can park in R or S spots. Motorcycles can park in R, S, or M spots. In the array of parking spots, spots are written in both lower-case and upper-case. An upper-case letter means that the particular spot is AVAILABLE, while lower-case letters mean that the spot is UNAVAILABLE.

Our function must return an array with the coordinates of the spot as an [X, Y] pair. See the example input and output below for an illustration.

Note: There may be multiple available spots for a particular vehicle. It does not matter which spot your function chooses, as long as the spot is available. And if there are no available spots, remember to return false.

Examples
```javascript
// Input:

const spots = [
// COLUMNS ARE X
//    0    1    2    3    4    5
    ['s', 's', 's', 'S', 'R', 'M'], // 0 ROWS ARE Y
    ['s', 'M', 's', 'S', 'R', 'M'], // 1
    ['s', 'M', 's', 'S', 'R', 'm'], // 2
    ['S', 'r', 's', 'm', 'R', 'M'], // 3
    ['S', 'r', 's', 'm', 'R', 'M'], // 4
    ['S', 'r', 'S', 'M', 'M', 'S'], // 5
]

const vehicle = 'regular' // possible options are 'regular', 'small', or 'motorcycle'
    
const output = [4, 0]
```

Hint: 
To go through a single array, we can use a single for-loop. To go through every element in an array of arrays, we can use two for-loops: one nested within the other.
