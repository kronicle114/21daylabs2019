## Challenge #17 - We're Rooting For You!
At this year's town festival the Codeville Vegetation Association will be handing out several awards for the best vegetables in a given category. We'll be testing out a new judging system on the best tomatoes to start, which can be judged based on their redness OR their plumpness.

### Instructions
For this challenge, we'll need to implement a function called judgeVegetable()that will decide which vegetable is best based on a given judging characteristic. Our function will receive two parameters: a list of veggies(as an array of objects), and a characteristic to judge the veggies by (in the case of a tomato, either redness or plumpness).

Our function must return the name of the person who submitted (vegetables.submitter) the vegetable with the highest ranking in the provided category.

Examples
Input:
```javascript
const v = [
  {
    submitter: 'Old Man Franklin',
    redness: 10,
    plumpness: 5
  },
  {
    submitter: 'Sally Tomato-Grower',
    redness: 2,
    plumpness: 8
  },
  {
    submitter: 'Hamid Hamidson',
    redness: 4,
    plumpness: 3
  }
]

const m = 'redness'
    
Output:
const output = 'Old Man Franklin'
```
